# ProjetJeuBanquise
A school project (in french).

Welcome to a C project created by CS students in seconde Year in France.

It's a game for one to four players.

The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach the finish point in a ice field with some obstacles.

I hope you enjoy this little game, remember that the code is made by students, so be indulgent.

If you have any advice, it'll be a pleasure to listen you!
